## üß† Problem Definition  
The goal of this project is to uncover actionable insights from customer transaction behavior to:

1. Identify distinct customer segments  
2. Support targeted marketing and personalized strategies  
3. Improve resource allocation and customer retention

This is approached using **unsupervised learning**, allowing clusters to emerge directly from the data.
